# ZYNT

**Signal monitoring custom-configured for your ICP.**

ZYNT surfaces sales opportunities with context and recommended actions - so your team knows when to reach out, why it matters, and what to say.

We handle the setup. You get intelligence delivered to your dashboard.

## The Problem

Critical buying signals are happening right now. Your competitors track them, engage prospects while your team is still researching, and close while you're still discovering.

Your team today: hours of manual research with less to show. Most signals missed entirely. No context when found. Always reacting, never anticipating.

## How ZYNT Works

This is not another tool to figure out. ZYNT is a done-for-you intelligence operation.

1. **Discovery** - We learn your customers, target accounts, what signals matter. 30 minutes, no commitment.
2. **Configuration** - We build your signal model. Keywords, scoring, delivery. You don't touch a thing.
3. **Launch** - Signals start flowing within days. We refine based on your feedback until it's exactly right.
4. **Clockwork** - 24/7 monitoring, prioritized alerts, recommended actions. Your research associate never sleeps.

## Who It's For

- People who need more than basic alerts - context and precision
- Anyone with target accounts but no system to monitor them at scale

## How ZYNT Is Different

**vs. Google Alerts** - Google Alerts sends everything matching a keyword. ZYNT sends what actually matters - with context on why and what to do about it.

**vs. Contact Data Platforms** - They give you WHO to reach. ZYNT gives you WHEN and WHY - the right moment because something just changed. We complement, not replace.

**vs. DIY Tools** - DIY needs a RevOps team and weeks of setup. ZYNT is done-for-you with a dedicated specialist. Live in days.

## The Shift

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| SDRs spend 3+ hours/day on manual research | Prioritized signals every hour |
| Important info found weeks late | Alerts within minutes with full context |
| Generic outreach, no specific angle | Personalized outreach based on triggers |
| 64% of buying signals missed | Catch what competitors miss |

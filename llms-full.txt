## The Problem

Critical buying signals are happening right now. Your competitors track news and signals, know when to reach out and why, engage prospects while your team is still researching, and close while you're still discovering.

Your team today: hours of manual research with less to show. Most signals missed entirely - no context when found. Always reacting, never anticipating. Less closing.

## The Shift: From Reactive to Proactive

From guessing to knowing. From second to first.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| SDRs spend 3+ hours/day on manual research | Prioritized signals delivered every hour |
| Find out about important information weeks late | Alert within minutes with full context |
| Generic outreach with no specific angle | Personalized outreach based on triggers |
| Miss buying signals (industry average: 64%) | Catch signals competitors miss entirely |

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is ZYNT different from Google Alerts?
Google Alerts sends you everything that matches a keyword. ZYNT sends you what actually matters - with context on why it matters and what to do about it. The difference between noise and intelligence.

### How is ZYNT different from contact data platforms?
Contact data platforms give you WHO to reach out to. ZYNT gives you WHEN and WHY - knowing the right moment because something just changed. We complement those tools, not replace them.

### How long does setup take?
Most customers are receiving signals within 2 weeks of the first call. We handle the configuration; you just provide context about your business.

### What data sources do you monitor?
Multiple source types including funding databases, news, job postings, social signals, company announcements, and more. We configure which sources matter for YOUR use case.

### Can I customize what signals I receive?
Absolutely. Customization is the whole point. We configure ZYNT for your specific ICP, target accounts, and signal priorities. No two ZYNT instances are the same.

## Why Signal Monitoring Matters

B2B sales teams operate in an environment of information asymmetry. The team that learns about a buying signal first - a funding round, an executive hire, a market expansion - has a measurable advantage in pipeline velocity and close rates.

Traditional approaches fail because:
- Manual research doesn't scale. An SDR monitoring 100+ accounts manually will miss the majority of relevant signals.
- Generic alerts create noise, not intelligence. Google Alerts and RSS feeds produce volume without context or prioritization.
- DIY tools require RevOps teams. Self-serve platforms assume you have dedicated operations staff to build and maintain workflows.

ZYNT exists because signal monitoring should be configured by experts and delivered with context that drives action.

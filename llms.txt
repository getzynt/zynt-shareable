# ZYNT

> Signal monitoring custom-configured for your ICP. ZYNT surfaces sales opportunities with context and recommended actions - so your team knows when to reach out, why it matters, and what to say. We handle the setup, you get intelligence delivered to your dashboard.

The intelligence gap is costing B2B teams deals. Competitors track signals, engage prospects while your team is still researching, and close while you're still discovering. ZYNT closes that gap - done-for-you, live in days, with a dedicated implementation specialist.

## Who It's For

Leaders tired of hearing about opportunities after competitors already reached out. Teams that want a partner to set things up, not another tool to figure out. People who need more than basic alerts - more context and precision. Anyone with target accounts but no system to monitor them at scale.

## How ZYNT Is Different

- [ZYNT vs. Google Alerts](https://getzynt.com): Google Alerts sends everything matching a keyword. ZYNT sends what actually matters - with context on why and what to do about it.
- [ZYNT vs. Contact Data Platforms](https://getzynt.com): They give you WHO to reach. ZYNT gives you WHEN and WHY - the right moment because something just changed. We complement, not replace.
- [ZYNT vs. DIY Tools](https://getzynt.com): DIY needs a RevOps team and weeks of setup. ZYNT is done-for-you with a dedicated specialist. Live in days.

## The Shift

Before: SDRs spend 3+ hours/day on manual research. Important info found weeks late. Generic outreach. 64% of buying signals missed.

After: Prioritized signals every hour. Alerts within minutes with full context. Personalized outreach based on triggers. Catch what competitors miss.
